## Snake Game
The player starts with a small snake on the screen and has to move around the space while collecting food in the form of dots that appear in different places. Every time the snake eats food, it gets longer and longer, which makes the game harder and harder to move around the screen.
However, the player must be careful that the snake does not hit the wall or his own body, as this means the end of the game. Also, the player can speed up the snake's movement to gather food faster, but this increases the risk of hitting obstacles.

## Rock Paper Scissors
The rules of the game are simple: players simultaneously choose "paper, rock, scissors" and then simultaneously choose one of three characters. Paper defeats rock because it wraps it, rock defeats scissors because it breaks them, and scissors defeat paper because they cut it.

If a tie occurs, play is repeated until a winner is reached. The player who first wins a certain number of points is the winner.

Paper rock scissors is a popular game played because of its simplicity and speed. The game can be customized with various variations, such as adding new characters or rules, which makes the game even more interesting. The game is popular among children and adults and can be played anywhere, without the need for additional equipment or tools.
